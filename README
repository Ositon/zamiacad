ZamiaCAD
========

ZamiaCAD (or Zamia, for short) is an Eclipse-based development environment 
for hardware designs in various hardware description languages, currently 
the focus is on VHDL 93. 

Zamia covers design entry, verification (simulation and testbench generation)
and analysis of logic designs. Zamia always works directly on the HDL source
code, thus not requiring any proprietary files to be generated and maintained.
This makes Zamia especially well suited for analyzing and editing pre-existing, 
large designs without forcing every engineer in the team to use it.

Main Features
-------------

 * Eclipse-based, integrated hardware design and analysis environment
 * Supported hardware description languages
      + Aims to be VHDL93
        (http://tech-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vhdl/tools/grammar/vhdl93-bnf.html)
        compliant, at the moment a (large) VHDL Subset is supported
      + Verilog (very limited)
 * Source HDL editors 
      + Syntax highlighting
      + Outline view
      + Goto declaration
 * RTL level event-based simulator and waveform viewer
 * RTL Graph Viewer 
      + Source-code back-annotation
      + Intuitive design navigation
      + Fully integrated with simulator, displays signal values
      + Dynamic mode for exploration of large designs
 * Navigator view
 * Full featured HDL compilers and build system completely built-in
 * Completely slef-contained, no external tools (simulators, compilers) required
      + Simulator View
      + FSM View
 * Written in Java (http://java.sun.com)

Although because of the platform-independant nature of both Java and Eclipse
Zamia should run on all platforms supported by these, at the moment limited
resources only allow us to support the GNU/Linux platform officially.

Big thanks to the Eclipse Project (http://www.eclipse.org) for their excellent
work on the best Java IDE out there!
